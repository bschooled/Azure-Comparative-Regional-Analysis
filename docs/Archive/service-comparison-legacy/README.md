# Archived: Legacy Service Comparison Docs

These documents are preserved for historical context.

They reference older output filenames/schemas (for example `output/services_comparison.*`) that no longer match the current `services_compare.sh` behavior.

## Current docs

Use the current region-only comparison guide instead:

- `docs/Usage/SERVICES_COMPARE.md`

## What’s archived here

- Older “service comparison” design/spec/implementation docs
- Older quickref/index pages for that legacy schema
